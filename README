	- RUN WITH VALGRIND FOR MEM LEAKS
	- further testing needs to be done for all 

+----+
|Use:|
+----+
	
	(TO USE WITH INTERFACE, run RR executeable -- basic error handling is done)

	1. Download Workable activity reports for each client (make sure they are in this folder)
		- for an accurate analysis of recruiter requirements, make sure 
		  that these are reports for the same span of time
	2. Run ListMerge on all activity reports: ./ListMerge [file1] [file2] [...]
		- files should be in standard activity report format (i.e. correct 
		  categories in the correct order - unaltered Workable reports already 
		  adhere to this format)
		- the filename for the new file (containing all activity across clients) 
		  should use the same naming format as Workable reports:
		  	activity_report_YYYY-MM-DD_YYYY-MM-DD.csv
	3. Run GetReview on the merged acitivty file: ./GetReview [file]
	4. Access the full report (parsed_report.csv) and summary (report_summary.csv).

* Note: all files (used in either program) should copied into RecruiterReview folder first

+-----------------+
|Alterative Usage:|
+-----------------+

	(NOT recommended -- helpful for getting familiar with commandline)

	Command prompt led usage. Allows for execution of both programs. 
	Run ./Easy and follow command prompts.
	- worse error handling
	- more cumbersome
	- functionality/mobility needs to be added

------------------------------------------ Details ---------------------------------------------

ListMerge
---------

Input:
	- This program is meant to be used on activity report csv files with categories:
		- Name
		- Activity
		- Candidate
		- Job
		- Creation time
		(this can be changed if necessary, by altering header.csv)
Output:
	- A .csv file that contains all the data from each activity report

run: ./ListMerge

GetReview
---------
Additional necessary improvements include:
	- making more universal functions/variables
	- clear commenting
	- valgrind check
	- optomize
	- ask for input instead of flag usage- or parse csv file name (this is done)

Input: 
	- This program is meant to be used on activity report csv files with categories:
		- Name
		- Activity
		- Candidate
		- Job
		- Creation time
		(this can be changed if necessary, by altering header.csv)

	- Please keep the csv name consistent with Workable activity report naming
	- For an accurate summary report requirement calculation, please make sure (1) the 
	  span of time is either one week or a few months and (2) the .csv file contains 
	  merged data from the same span of time

* there is a file included in this folder called "header.csv" which can be altered if
  the categories need to be changed

Output:

	parsed_report.csv - report containing every interview and sendout with details, sorted 
						by person and job title
	report_summary.csv - summary containing total interviews, sendouts, and completion of
						 requirements:
						 	- 5 interviews per day
						 	- 5 sendouts per week
					   - does not discount holidays or vacation time
					   - for accurate report, activity report file needs to 
					     contain each client for the same span of time


run: ./GetReview
